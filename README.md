# My Mahalla

My Mahalla - a mobile app to reach local government agencies. It helps Uzbek citizens reach government agencies and access their services via mobile app. No need to call or wait in lines anymore.

## How It Works

**My Mahalla** can be used as a tool to report issues with further detail as:
- Category
- Urgency level
- Geolocation
- Description
- Title
- Media


Citizens can report issues in more detail in an easy way and our app ensures that it reaches the appropriate authority.
This is a tool to send the request with detailed information to the relevant state authority.
We don't only deliver issues, but also group and filter them in a way that is convenient for the citizens to track issues.
Through the following statistics, we can see issues reported per organization in Tashkent region for 2 months (according to years until 2020). The highest number of applications was reported in Tashkent Mayor's office while the lowest number is recorded in the Ministry of Finance. Central Bank and the Ministry of Labor received almost the same number of reported issues.
